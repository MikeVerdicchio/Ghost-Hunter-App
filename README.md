### Introduction
This repository contains the Android development files for a game entitled "Ghost Hunter." It was developed by four second-year students in the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](http://www.seas.virginia.edu/) at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/) in the fall of 2014. As a project for Software Development Methods (CS 2110), the focus was to get aquainted with Android development and to create a game that was optimized for the Nexus 7 tablet on Kit Kat (Android 4.4, API 19).
