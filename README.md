Ghost Hunter

Introduction
This repository contains the Android development files for a game entitled "Ghost Hunter." It was developed by four second-year students in the School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Virginia in the fall of 2014. As a project for Software Development Methods (CS 2110), the focus was to get aquainted with Android development and to create a game that was optimized for the Nexus 7 tablet on Kit Kat (Android 4.4, API 19).
